   - If you want the report to be *private*, mention that when opening the issue and include a contact email. Note: GitHub issues are public by default.
2. **Send an email** to the project maintainer: `replace-with-your-email@example.com`

**Maintainer / Contact:**

(Replace the email above with your real address if you want private reports.)

## Enforcement guidelines
